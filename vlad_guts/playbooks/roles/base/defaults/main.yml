# Private files directory.

# If you elect to use a private files directory with your Drupal site, 
# chances are that you'll want it outside of the main codebase
# and for it to be synced between host & guest. Let's use vlad_aux then.
# Accepted values:
# - false (default): no directory created
# - true: creates vlad_aux/private
# - string: creates vlad_aux/[string]

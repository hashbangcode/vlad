# This is based on geerlingguy's Drush role [2015/07/27] but with tweaks:
#
# - 'sudo' specified at the task level if required
# - Doesn't clone the entire Drush repo (depth)
# - Role dependencies have been removed
# - Added 'drush_composer_path' var to fill in for missing dependencies
# - Default Drush version changed (not master).
